#flag: crypto{bijection}

#explanation:
#a bijection, also known as a bijective function, one-to-one correspondence, or invertible function, 
#is a function between the elements of two sets, 
#where each element of one set is paired with exactly one element of the other set, 
#and each element of the other set is paired with exactly one element of the first set. 
#There are no unpaired elements. 
#In mathematical terms, a bijective function f: X â†’ Y is a one-to-one (injective)
#and onto (surjective) mapping of a set X to a set Y.
